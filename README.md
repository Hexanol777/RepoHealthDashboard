## Authentication (Optional) 

To increase API rate limits, you can add a **GitHub personal access token**:

- Open `github_api.py`
- Add your token in the `HEADERS` dictionary:

```python
HEADERS = {
    "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"
}
```

Tokens are generated [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
